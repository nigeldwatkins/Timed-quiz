# Timed-quiz

## Objective 

For this weeks assignment I was asked to create a timed quiz assesment based on questions about Javascript, once the quiz is completed I was then asked to create a system that tracks the score from my user and saves it to a local storage.

## Preview of Quiz

This code is a quiz that allows the user to answer a set of JavaScript questions within a 60-second time frame. The quiz is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It starts by displaying instructions for the quiz, which disappear when the user clicks the "Start" button. The quiz then displays a series of questions with multiple-choice answers, and the user must choose the correct answer within the given time limit.
At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their name, and their score is saved locally along with their name. The code uses an array of objects to store the quiz questions, choices, and correct answers. It also uses the setInterval() method to implement the countdown timer, and the clearInterval() method to stop the timer when the quiz is over.
